# Analog_Clock_withSound
Hello, this is an Analog clock as you can find on some desktop screens, along with the tickling sound of the seconds needle . I have designed it using HTML , CSS and JavaScript for the functionality. The clock shows exactly the same time as your computer i.e.  the IST time.
